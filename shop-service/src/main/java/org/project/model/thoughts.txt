when assigning tables to microservices  I made
a mistake joining them together even though they were in separate services.
When reading articles from internet I learnt that this is a bad practice
I would better off make few entities per service and tie them together through
RestClient
All I left with is either copying classes from each service to one another or
making cyclical dependencies.
Right now my model structure in shop-service is not working except my
IntelJ idea generated diagram that is correct
But in the end(...) I refreshed knowledge on how to make
 Many-To-Many, One-To-Many relationships and to solve N+1 problem
